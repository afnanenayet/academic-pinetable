# Lone Pinetable

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/afnanenayet/academic-pinetable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/afnanenayet/academic-pinetable)

## Synopsis

This is a revamp of the Dartmouth academic timetable, because it's ugly and
sucks for searching things.

## Technical details

We're going to have the frontend be in React, and the backend will be in Flask
as an API for the frontend to query. In the codebase, we have it split up as
source code for the frontend client and the backend. The backend is in Flask,
and the frontend is in React.

Ideally we'll throw this up on gcloud or AWS.

## Progress/roadmap

TBD
